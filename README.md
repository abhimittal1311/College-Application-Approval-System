# Introduction:

The College Application Approval System aims to provide a comprhensive online system that allows users to submit application requests, such as Admission Applications, Leave Applications, Medical Applications, etc. The application allows users to submit an admission application to the campus of their choice, and if admitted, allows the admitted student to submit various other types of application requests. The administrator (or teacher) on the other hand, can view the list of admission applications, and choose to accept or reject the applicaiton. The administrator can also view a list of all the admitted students, and can view all active application requests from the admitted students, and has the ability to accept or reject the requests. The system incorporates high-security measures to protect user data and ensures user-friendly experience accessible via PC with internet connectivity.

# Key Features:

* User Registration and Login:
  - Students will be able to register and add an admission application to their preferred campus by supplying necessary information by going to the user registration page. Users who have successfully been registered and admitted to the campus, can then go and securely login using their email address and password.
  - There is only one Admin (Teacher) for each campus who will be the super user, therefore will not require registration.

* Student Features:
  - Student profiles can be created by entering personal information as requested in the registration form. However, a newly registered student will only be able to submit an Admission Application.
  - Once admitted, an email is sent to the student containing a default password that they can use to access their dashboard, and add various applications including Medical Application, Leave Application and a Gate Pass Application. The student can also track the applicaitons they have submitted.
  - The student also has the ability to change their password, should they wish to do so.
  - If the admission is rejected, an email is sent to the student notifying them of the rejection and their profile will automatically be deleted from the database, and the student won't be able to login to the system.

* Administrator Features:
  -  As the Admin, the user will have access to all the admission applications submitted to their respective campus, as well as to the information of all the candidates who have submitted the applications. The Admin will also have the ability to accept or reject an admission application, fully at their own discretion.
  -  The Admin will have access to a list of students that have already been admitted to the institution, and at any point, can remove a student from the record, thereby terminating the student's admission.
  -  The Admin will have access to all the application requests submitted by the admitted students, and will have the ability to accept or reject the request, fully at their own discretion.
  -  The Admin also has the ability to change their password, should they wish to do so.

# Tools and Technologies:

* Java: A versatile and object-oriented programming language known for its portability and wide applications. It's platform-independent, has a rich standard library, supports multi-threading, and emphasizes security. With tools like the Java Development Kit (JDK) and Java Virtual Machine (JVM), developers can create web, mobile, and enterprise applications. Java is especially popular for Android app development and enterprise systems due to its scalability and reliability.

* HTML: The standard markup language used to create and structure content on the web. It defines the elements and layout of a web page, including headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. HTML provides the foundational structure that browsers use to render web content.

* CSS: A stylesheet language that controls the presentation and layout of HTML elements. It allows developers to define how elements should be styled, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. CSS enables consistent and visually appealing designs across web pages.

* JavaScript: A versatile scripting language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It can manipulate HTML and CSS, respond to user actions, and interact with web servers. JavaScript is essential for creating features like form validation, animations, and real-time updates without requiring page reloads.

* Bootstrap: A popular open-source front-end framework that simplifies web development. Developed by Twitter, it provides a set of pre-designed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components that help developers create responsive, visually appealing, and consistent web interfaces. With Bootstrap, you can quickly build modern websites and web applications without extensive design or coding expertise. It offers a responsive grid system, typography, navigation bars, buttons, forms, and other UI elements, streamlining the development process and ensuring compatibility across different devices and screen sizes.

* MySQL: A widely used open-source relational database system. It stores and manages structured data using SQL, offering performance, scalability, and security. It's popular for web applications, content management systems, e-commerce, analytics, and more. With different editions like Community and Enterprise, MySQL suits various needs.

* JSP: A technology used in web development to create dynamic web pages by combining Java code and HTML content. With JSP, developers embed Java code within HTML templates to generate dynamic content that can be sent to the client's web browser. JSP pages are processed by a web server, which translates the Java code into HTML before sending it to the client. This allows for the creation of interactive and data-driven web applications, where Java logic can be used to generate content based on user inputs, database queries, or other dynamic factors. JSP is commonly used alongside servlets and other Java technologies to build server-side components of web applications.

* JDBC: A Java-based API that enables Java applications to interact with relational databases. It provides a standardized way for Java programs to execute SQL queries, retrieve data, and update databases. JDBC acts as a bridge between Java applications and various database management systems (DBMS), allowing developers to connect, communicate, and manage data seamlessly. It provides a set of classes and interfaces that facilitate database operations and data manipulation within Java applications.

* Particle JS: A JavaScript library that enables the creation of interactive and visually appealing particle animations on websites. With Particle.js, developers can generate dynamic backgrounds or effects that simulate particles moving, reacting to user interactions, and forming patterns. This library simplifies the process of adding such particle animations to web pages by providing a range of customizable options for particle shape, size, color, motion, and behavior. Particle.js is commonly used to enhance the visual aesthetics and engagement of websites by incorporating dynamic particle effects without requiring complex coding skills.

* NetBeans IDE: An open-source integrated development environment (IDE) primarily used for Java development, but it supports multiple programming languages. It offers tools and features that streamline the process of coding, testing, and deploying software applications. NetBeans includes features like code editors with syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging capabilities. It also supports version control systems, graphical user interface design, and project management. With a user-friendly interface and a rich set of plugins, NetBeans IDE provides a comprehensive environment for software development, catering to both beginners and experienced developers.
